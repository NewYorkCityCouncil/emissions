** Greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 LL84 benchmarking data ** 

** The Data **

- For mid-size (25000-50000 sqft), there is 52% compliance
- The ghg/sqft value was derived by normalizing the total ghg emissions by the total square feet
- Occupancy groups were manually checked for certain groups to ensure accuracy cl 

These scripts explore the 2024 and 2030 targets and how the occupancy groups will be imapcted.
