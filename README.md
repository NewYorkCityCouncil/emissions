# Greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 LL84 benchmarking data
These scripts explore the 2024 and 2030 targets and how the occupancy groups will be imapcted. 

**The Data**

- *For mid-size (25000-50000 sqft) buildings, there is 52% compliance (so not the total universe of these sized buildings)
- The ghg/sqft value was derived by normalizing the total ghg emissions by the total square feet
- GHGs are calculated at the BBL level 
- These data include buildings that exceed 25,000 gross square feet or two or more buildings on the same tax lot that together exceed 50,000 gross square feet (9290 m2)
